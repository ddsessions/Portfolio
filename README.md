## About Me

Welcome to my corner of the interwebs! I am looking for opportunities in an entry-level role in software development or a similar field.

I have a Computer Science associate degree from Southern New Hampshire University, and I am currently studying Codecademy's full-stack engineer career path program.

I have gained experience in Python, Java, and C++ through coursework as well as HTML and CSS independently. I'm currently working on C# and .NET. I'm familiar with Windows, MacOS, JetBrains IDEs, and Visual Studio.

## Portfolio Overview

I am building this portfolio from scratch in parallel to completing the Codecademy courses. As my skills continue to improve and develop, I will make further changes to my portfolio.

## Tools Used so Far

- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
