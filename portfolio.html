                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hi, I'm D.D. I live in Auburn, Alabama with my husband, kids, dog, cat, and leopard gecko. I enjoy baking custom cakes and cupcakes, gaming, music, coffee, Harry Potter, movie nights, and nearly anything creative.
                        <br><br>
                        I am seeking opportunities in an entry-level role in software development or a similar field. Currently, I work as a legal assistant and have experience in management, training, call centers, customer service, and working on teams with strict deadlines. 
                        <br><br>
                        I have an Associate of Science degree in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University. I am currently studying Codecademy's full-stack engineer career path program.
                        <br><br>
                        I have experience in Python, Java, and C++ through school coursework as well as HTML and CSS independently. I would love to work with C# and .NET which I'm also currently studying on my own. I'm familiar with Windows, MacOS, JetBrains IDEs, and Visual Studio.</p>

                    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                        <p>Building this portfolio was a labor of love. As I mentioned, I am a career-changer with no previous tech or development experience. I took a basic programming class in high school many years ago, but it wasn't until 2021 that I finally made the decision to enroll in college and pursue this career path. Creating responsive websites and functional programs is fascinating to me, and I am committed to learning the necessary skills to transition into the tech field.
                        <br><br>
                        This portfolio is my first project that I built completely from scratch start to finish. I will continue to make improvements as I grow my skill set. Tools that I used to build this portfolio include:

                            Website and Facebook administrator - I rebuilt the website for my current employer and brought hosting in-house which saves $7,500 on an annual contract with a digital marketing company. I opted for a Wordpress rebuild due to the ease of maintenance once I transition into a new role.
